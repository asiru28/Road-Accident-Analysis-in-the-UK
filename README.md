# Road-Accident-Analysis-in-the-UK

# Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of road accidents in the UK using Power BI. It explores accident trends over time, their severity, and contributing factors such as road conditions, weather, and vehicle type.

# Objectives

- Identify trends in road accidents based on time, location, and contributing factors.
- Analyse the severity of accidents to determine high-risk factors.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to improve road safety.

# Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from publicly available UK road accident records, stored on GitHub.

# Tools Used

- Power BI Desktop for data preprocessing, data visualisation and reporting

# Insights

- A significant number of accidents occur during daylight, but night-time accidents tend to be more severe.
- Urban areas report higher accident numbers, whereas rural areas see a higher percentage of severe accidents.
- Weather conditions, such as rain and fog, contribute to increased casualties.
- Speed limits play a key role, with a notable number of casualties in areas with a 30-40 mph speed limit.

# Recommendations

- Implement stricter speed control measures in accident-prone areas.
- Improve road lighting and visibility to reduce night-time accidents.
- Enhance public awareness of road safety, especially for motorcyclists.
- Develop better infrastructure to reduce the impact of adverse weather conditions on driving.
